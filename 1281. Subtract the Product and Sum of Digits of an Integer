#Question:
#Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
class Solution:
    def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        l = []
        for digit in str(n):
            l.append (int(digit))
            product=1
            s=0
        for i in l:
            product*= i
            s+= i
        difference= product-s
        return difference
