#Question:
#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#You can return the answer in any order.
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        arr= {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n= target- nums[i]
            if n in arr:
                return [arr[n], i]
            arr[nums[i]]=i
#to return an empty list (if no answer is found)
        return []
